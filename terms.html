                </p>

              <p class="privacy-text">
                11.1 Informal negotiations
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating the arbitration. These informal discussions start when one party notifies the other in writing that they will commence.
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                11.2 Arbitration Obligatory
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                If a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute via informal talks, the Disputes (excluding those Disputes specifically excluded herein) shall be decided conclusively and exclusively by binding arbitration. YOU ARE AWARE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where applicable, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are accessible at www.adr.org. Your arbitration expenses and your portion of the arbitration award shall be controlled by the AAA Consumer Rules and, if applicable, restricted by the AAA Consumer Rules. If the arbitrator determines that these charges are exorbitant, we shall cover all arbitration fees and costs. The arbitration can take place in the Cayman Islands, unless prohibited by the applicable AA rules or applicable legislation. Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, delay proceedings until arbitration, or to confirm, amend, vacate, or enter judgment on the arbitrator's decision.
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, the Dispute shall be initiated or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands, and the Parties waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such courts.
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                In no circumstances may any Dispute filed by any Party relating in any manner to the Site, the App, or the Smart Contracts be brought more than one (1) year after the cause of action has arisen. If this provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within the portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                11.3 Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration Requirements
                <br class="spacing"></br>
                The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provision regarding informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, and of a Party's intellectual property rights; (b) any Dispute relating to or arising from allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal and unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within the portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
